FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

A problem occurred configuring root project 'example'.
> Could not determine the dependencies of task ':consumer:compileJava'.
 > Could not resolve all task dependencies for configuration ':consumer:compileClasspath'.
    > Could not resolve project :producer.
      Required by:
          project :consumer
       > project :producer requires at least a Java 18 JVM. This build uses a Java 17 JVM.

* Try:
> Run this build using a Java 18 JVM (or newer).
> Change the dependency on 'project :producer' to an earlier version that supports JVM runtime version 17.

=== Provider API & laziness
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

=== Provider API
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Deferred value resolution
* Automatic task dependency management
* Improved build performance

=== Why laziness matters
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

=== Challenge: Deferred resolution
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Evaluation ordering
** `afterEvaluate` does not scale
** How "after" do you need to be?

=== Challenge: Automatic task dependencies
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Tasks produce files
** How do you make sure the consumer of that file `dependsOn` the producing task?

=== Solution
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

image::laziness.png[]

=== Provider API: Evaluation Ordering
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Wire and derive values
** Without caring about *when* it is set
* Evaluation is done on demand
** Task does not run -> No inputs are computed

=== Provider API: Execution Ordering
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Task output properties
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used as input to another task
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;track task dependencies automatically.

=== Provider API: Performance impact
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* A lazy computation
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used as task input
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only needs to be computed if the task executes

=== Property wiring example
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[source,kotlin]
----
val producer = tasks.register<Producer>("producer")
val consumer = tasks.register<Consumer>("consumer")

consumer {
    // Connect the producer task output to the consumer task input
    // Don't need to add a task dependency to the consumer task.
    // This is automatically added
    inputFile = producer.flatMap { it.outputFile }
}

producer {
    // Set values for the producer lazily
    // Don't need to update the consumer.inputFile property.
    // This is automatically updated as producer.outputFile changes
    outputFile = layout.buildDirectory.file("file.txt")
}

// Change the build directory.
// Don't need to update producer.outputFile and consumer.inputFile.
// These are automatically updated as the build directory changes
layout.buildDirectory = layout.projectDirectory.dir("output")
----

=== Adoption challenge
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Existing Gradle API is large
** Lots of "properties" to convert
* Alternative (minor) -> Deprecation (minor) -> Removal (major)
** Disruptive cycle
** Long cycle
* Bridging plain properties and Provider API is awkward
* In short, does not scale

=== Provider API migration
image::gradle/bg-6.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Do a large scale migration of Gradle APIs in Gradle 9.0
* Supported by automatic conversion for plugins
* Requires polishing the Provider API itself
* ⚠️ Does not resolve the adoption by community plugins
