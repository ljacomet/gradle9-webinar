=== Gradle 9 objectives
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* 🐘 Core updates
* &#x1F4A1; Comprehensibility
* &#x1F680; Scalability

=== Gradle 9 - 🐘 Core updates
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Kotlin Language 2.0 support in our Kotlin DSL
* Use the K2 compiler and benefit from its performance
* Groovy 4
* Tools and libraries updates
* Many bug fixes and improvements

=== Gradle 9 - &#x1F4A1; Comprehensibility
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Provider API 1.0
** Feature complete for supported use cases
* Provider API Migration
** Binary compatible migration for 3rd party plugins
** Source-compatible migration for local build logic
* Problems API

=== Gradle 9 - &#x1F680; Scalability
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Configuration Cache recommended
[%step]
** Deprecation warning if not enabled in later 9.x

=== Gradle 9.0 timeline
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

* Q1 2025 release (tentative)

=== Ongoing work

=== Configuration cache limitations
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* What about the work of the build engineer?
* What about dependency upgrades and other build focused engineering tasks?

[.notes]
****
* Invalidation
* No Remote  Cache

=== Did you say cache miss?
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* On a miss, the configuration phase needs to run
* But, with no shared mutable state between projects, it could
[%step]
** Run in parallel
*** following the projects hierarchy
** Be cached incrementally
*** task sub-graphs cached per project

=== Isolated Projects Status
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

* Alpha experiment on top of the Configuration Cache
* Interesting for early adopters
* Focuses on speeding up the IDE experience first

[.notes]
****
* We're really close to have IntelliJ and Gradle ready for early adopters

=== Declarative Gradle

🐘

=== Declarative Gradle
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

> The presence of code constructs in the software definition, such as variables, local methods and conditional expressions, makes it hard for software developers to work with the build.
>
> It also makes refactoring more difficult for the IDE and other tools to implement.

[.notes]
****
* While it has long been a best practice that build scripts should be declarative, and the build logic should be kept in plugins, this is not the reality for many projects.
* We’ve seen projects in the wild that mix declarative and imperative code and make build scripts that are long and complex.
* Gradle-specific concepts used in build scripts are not always familiar to software developers.
* This can make Gradle less approachable for developers unfamiliar with Gradle.
* At the same time, it makes it difficult for the IDEs to offer reliable support for editing build scripts.

=== Declarative Gradle
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Clear separation of software definition from build logic
* Declarative configuration language
* Raised abstraction
* First class IDE experience

=== Declarative Gradle
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* New *experimental* initiative
* Working group with Google, JetBrains and Gradle.
* First EAP available
* Second EAP in October 2024
* See declarative.gradle.org
